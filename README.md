'Hold the mirror up to yourself, it will not lie to you ...'

- Get together in twos and threes over a short period of time (weeks ...)
- Collaborate on learning to develop, deploy, monitor, manage, and evolve a modern software application in the cloud (on AWS)
- Learn about new things every step of the way, and bring your learning alive before your own eyes. Know why you made the decisions that mattered.

All you need to participate is a can-do attitude, and commitment to make it to the finish line!
